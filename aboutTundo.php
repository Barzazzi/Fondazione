      <p>Full Professor of Organic Chemistry (retired in 2016), Pietro Tundo is a scientist with a high international profile who has made substantial improvement in a number of fields of chemistry.<br>
        He is responsible of scientific projects on Green Chemistry at Ca’ Foscari University of Venice and Coordinator of UNESCO-UNITWIN “Green Chemistry Excellence from Baltic Sea to Mediterranean Sea and Beyond” with Politecnico of Milan.
        He is Member of the Bureau of IUPAC and Chair of IUPAC Interdivisional Committee on Green Chemistry for Sustainable Development.<br>
        Pietro Tundo is Italian Representative of OECD for Sustainable Chemistry OECD’s Programme and member of the International Jury of the Phosagro/UNESCO/IUPAC Award on Green Chemistry.<br>
        Tundo was President of Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry Division of IUPAC (biennium 2007-2009) and holder of the Unesco Chair on Green Chemistry (UNTWIN N.o 731). He founded and was Chairman (2004-2016) of the Working Party on “Green and Sustainable Chemistry”of EuCheMS (European Association for Chemical and Molecular Sciences).<br>
        Founder of the IUPAC International Conferences Series on Green Chemistry, he was awarded by American Chemical Society on 1983 (Kendall Award, with Janos Fendler), and by Federchimica (Italian association of chemical industries) on 1997 (An Intelligent Future).<br>
        Tundo coordinated many institutional and industrial research projects (EU, NATO, Dow, ICI, Roquette) and was the founder and the Director of the 10 editions of the annual Summer Schools on Green Chemistry (Venezia, Italy) sponsored by the EU, UNESCO and NATO.<br>
